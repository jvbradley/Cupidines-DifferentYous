04 June 2020:
 - Make music play throughout, and give players an information alert that music may be loud and take a moment to load.
 -- Addressed.
 - Separate death dialog of Ulf into two panels.


02 June 2020:
 - Options on first page: First: You are Ulf, the Villager. / Second option: You are Liv, the Viking.
 -- Addressed.
 -- Also added dialog boxes with images from Charda for both Ulf and Liv.
 - Move images to left of text.
 -- Addressed.
 -- Also created a one-pixel white border to help distinguish picture from background.
 - Adjust link text color of dialog boxes - green is difficult to see.
 -- Adjusted text, dialog link text, and action text to be more easily distinguishable from each other.

 - Ulf is the villager.  Is getting killed.  Rune and Liv are syblings.
 - Either Rune or Liv end up killing Ulf.
 -- Correcting text.

 - Viking watch sneak away: What if he doesn't get a drink or see the old man?
 -- Drink issue addressed.
 -- Removed option to turn in early from the ceremony if feeling scared.  Feeling scared only ensures that the villager (Ulf) will not see the old man.
 - Viking (Liv): Her story will also need to have the option to make the pact with Ulf (the villager) and friend.

 - Crazy Old Man text: It feels like a lot.  Make it bite-size chunks.
 -- Unable to address: Parsing single/double quotes to pass between variables inside a pop-up dialog box seems to confuse the browser on what it's actually supposed to be doing.  I adjusted the paragraph sizes a bit.
 - Death text: It feels like a lot.  Make it bite-size chunks.



=====

 - Good story to start.  Clickable dialog didn't make any sense for purpose.
 -- Addressed.
 - Adding the dialog to the existing text was handy, but it can cause you to lose your place where you're reading.
 -- Addressed.
 - Players don't have any sense of what to expect when navigating.  You may want to set different colors for text-expanding link and links to new panels.
 -- Addressed.

Keiro:
 - Add attack bonuses to enemies.

Charda:
 - Suggested limiting character age to 14.
 - Provided images via Discord.
 - Set Viking as first option.

Jim:
 - Demonstrated initial working version.
 - I will build mechanics and panels to follow the spirit of the story as closely as intended.
 - I will be working on this over the weekend with a rough working copy available and posted in Discord by 8 A.M. PST on Monday.
